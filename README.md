# GitHub-Actions-CICD-Pipeline-Python-App

## Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for a Python application. The pipeline automates the processes of testing, building, and deploying the application to ensure seamless integration and delivery.

## Project Workflow

1. **Code Commit:** Developers push code to the GitHub repository.
2. **Automated Testing:** GitHub Actions runs unit tests to validate the application's functionality.
3. **Build Process:** The pipeline builds the application into a deployable format.
4. **Deployment:** The built application is deployed to the desired environment (e.g., a server, container, or cloud platform).

### **Pipeline Structure**

| **Stage**           | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Checkout**         | Fetches the latest code from the repository.                               |
| **Set Up Environment** | Installs dependencies and sets up the Python environment.                |
| **Unit Tests**       | Executes automated tests to verify application functionality.              |
| **Build**            | Packages the application for deployment.                                  |
| **Deploy**           | Deploys the application to the target environment.                        |

## Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Repository:** A repository containing the Python application code.
2. **Configured GitHub Actions:** Enable GitHub Actions in the repository settings.
3. **Secrets Management:** Add necessary secrets for deployment, such as API keys or environment variables.
4. **Python Version:** Ensure the desired Python version is specified in the configuration.
