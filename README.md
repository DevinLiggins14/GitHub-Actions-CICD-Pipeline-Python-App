## **üìñ Step-by-Step Guide**

### **Step 1: Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow**
1. Navigate to your repository's **Actions** tab.
2. Click **New Workflow** and choose **Set Up a Workflow Yourself**.
3. Save the following workflow file as `.github/workflows/main.yml`.

<br/> The pipline will begin but we will see it has failed since the DockerHub account and password has not been defined <br/> 
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a81903d-4c0b-413d-87ac-b8e57b152494"/>



## Step 2: Define the DockerHub account user name and password 

<br/> Go to Secrets and Variables within GitHub  to configure the DockerHub user name and password <br/> 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/158d4434-ed7c-4eec-a5aa-953b600a2f95"/>
<br/> Enter the correct information <br/>

<br/> That worked but we have another error: <br/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ceabded-9bab-4bd8-baf1-529b5f5b2538"/>
<br/> This error is because the Dockerfile is in the incorrect path within GitHub, it should be in BreadcrumbsGitHub-Actions-CICD-Pipeline-Python-App/Dockerfile (Double check the other file paths as well),
 <br/> 

 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f756870-d064-4010-ac38-e22f4f686fa2"/>
<br/> Fixed, now lets check the actions tab since it will be automatically updated once new code has been added automatically. <br/>
 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36c0d73f-d58c-4d95-9501-fededefc2ffe"/>
<br/> It appears the test was successful but the test was not <br/>

<br/> The Docker image is even visible now on my DockerHub profile <br/> 
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d621790-191a-4fd6-876b-1752686a9f7b"/>
<br/> Now to investigate why the test was unsuccessful <br/>

<br/> This issue appears to be from a <br/>
